      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries across the globe, from finance to manufacturing, but perhaps its most transformative impact is being felt in healthcare. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and assist in decision-making, AI is reshaping how medical professionals diagnose, treat, and manage patient care.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of AI in healthcare has opened doors to unprecedented advancements—early disease detection, personalized treatment plans, robotic-assisted surgeries, and streamlined administrative processes. However, this technological evolution also brings challenges, including ethical concerns, data security risks, and barriers to adoption.  \n",

      "Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems that mimic human cognitive functions, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. Key subsets of AI used in healthcare include:  \n",
      "- **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms that improve through data exposure (e.g., predicting patient outcomes).  \n",
      "- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML using neural networks for complex tasks like medical imaging analysis.  \n",
      "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enabling AI to interpret and generate human language (e.g., analyzing clinical notes).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **AI vs. Traditional Computing in Healthcare**  \n",
      "Unlike rule-based systems, AI adapts and learns from data, making it more dynamic in diagnosing and predicting diseases. Traditional computing follows predefined instructions, whereas AI can uncover hidden insights in unstructured data like radiology images or genetic sequences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Historical Evolution**  \n",
      "AI's journey in healthcare dates back to the 1970s with early expert systems like MYCIN (diagnosing bacterial infections). Today, AI powers everything from chatbots to robotic surgeries, driven by advancements in computing power and big data.  \n",
